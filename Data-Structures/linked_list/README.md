# Linked Lists

## Data Structure
Linked Lists 

## Challenge
Implement a Singly Linked List Data Structure.

## Approach & Efficiency
-Space and Time:
	- Creating the Linked List
		- Time: O(1) - We are doing one thing to one object 
		- Space: O(1) - We are creating One new object
	- Insert:
		- Time: O(1) - We are doing one thing to an object 
		- Space: O(1) - We are adding one thing to one object
	- Include:
		- Time: O(n) - We are running through the entire List
		- Space: O(1) - We do not need to create any new objects
	-Print:
		- Time: O(n) - We are running through the entire List
		- Space: O(1) - We do not need to create any new objects
	-Append:
		- Time: O(n) - We are running through the entire list
		- Space: O(1) - We are only creating one new thing
	-InsertAfter:
		- Time: O(n) - We are running through the entire list
		- Space: O(1) - We are only creating one new thing
	-InsertBefore:
		- Time: O(n) - We are running through the entire list
		- Space: O(1) - We are only creating one new thing
