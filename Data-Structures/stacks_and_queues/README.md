# Stacks and Queues

## Data Structure
Stacks and Queus

## Challenge
Implement a Stacks Data Structure and a Queues Data Structure.

## Approach & Efficiency
-Space and Time:
	- Create Stack
		- Time: O(1) - We do not have to run through anything 
		- Space: O(1) - We do not create anything new 
	- Add
		- Time: O(1) - We simply tack our value onto the top, no while loops
		- Space: O(1) - We do not create anything new 
	- Pop
		- Time: O(1) - We simply tack our value onto the top, no while loops
		- Space: O(1) - We do not create anything new
	- Peek
		- Time: O(1) - We do not have to use a while or for loop so Time is O(1)
		- Space: O(1) - We do not create anything new
	- Create Queueue
		- Time: O(1) - We do not have to run through anything 
		- Space: O(1) - We do not create anything new 
	- Enqueue
		- Time: O(1) - We do not need to run through anything, we just tack our new value to the front
		- Space: O(1) - we don't create anything new that takes signifigant space
	- Dequeue
		- Time: O(1) - We do not run through anything, time is O(1)
		- Space: O(1) - We don't create anything new
